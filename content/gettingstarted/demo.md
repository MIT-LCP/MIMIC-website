# MIMIC-III demo

The MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care) Clinical Database contains comprehensive clinical data relating to tens of thousands of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients. This MIMIC-III demo database is a demo version of the database which is limited to 100 patients and excludes the noteevents table.

The demo dataset (v1.4) can be downloaded either as 25 comma-separated-value (CSV) files or as a single Postgres database backup file (Postgres 9.5). Scripts for building a local copy of the MIMIC-III database using the CSV files are available in the [MIMIC Code Repository](https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-code).
