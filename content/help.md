# Help and support

MIMIC is provided through the work of researchers at the MIT Laboratory for Computational Physiology and [our collaborators](/about/acknowledgments/). We have limited resources and cannot provide individual support to researchers worldwide. 

We therefore encourage MIMIC users to work together as a community. Please read [our notes on how to get involved](/community/contributing/) for further information.

## How can I get help with my analysis?

If you are seeking advice for a specific question, we would suggest raising an issue on the [MIMIC Code Repository](https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-code/issues). 

## How can I highlight an issue relating to the MIMIC dataset?

MIMIC is a complex dataset and we understand that there are many open questions, both in terms of the data and its analysis. If you identify an issue with the MIMIC data (for example, errors in the data, unusual characteristics, etc), we suggest raising an issue on the [MIMIC Code Repository](https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-code/issues).

## How do I raise an issue on the MIMIC Code Repository?

To raise an issue, first navigate to the [MIMIC Code Repository](https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-code/issues). After logging in to GitHub, click "New issue", add a title and description of the problem, and then select the "Submit new issue" button.

Public discussion reaches a larger audience, enables wider discourse, and reduces workload on our laboratory. One exception is where a topic is sensitive, for example relating to patient health information. **If you need to raise a private issue, please contact us using the method noted below.**

# Contact us

If you need to raise an issue privately, outside the public forums, please contact us at: [mimic-support@physionet.org](mailto:mimic-support@physionet.org).
