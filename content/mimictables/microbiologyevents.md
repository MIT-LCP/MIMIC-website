# The microbiologyevents table

**Table source:** Hospital database.

**Table purpose:** Contains microbiology information, including tests performed and sensitivities.

**Number of rows:** 328,446

**Links to:**

* PATIENTS on `SUBJECT_ID`
* ADMISSIONS on `HADM_ID`
* D\_ITEMS on `SPEC_ITEMID`
* D\_ITEMS on `ORG_ITEMID`
* D\_ITEMS on `AB_ITEMID`

# Important considerations

* The MICROBIOLOGYEVENTS table does not contain cultures from samples taken outside the ICU
* If the specimen is null, then the culture had no growth reported.

# Detailed Description

## `SUBJECT_ID`, `HADM_ID`

Identifiers which specify the patient: `SUBJECT_ID` is unique to a patient and `HADM_ID` is unique to a patient hospital stay.

## `CHARTDATE`, `CHARTTIME`

`CHARTTIME` records the time at which an observation was charted, and is usually the closest proxy to the time the data was actually measured.
`CHARTDATE` is the same as `CHARTTIME`, except there is no time available.

`CHARTDATE` was included as time information is not always available for microbiology measurements: in order to be clear about when this occurs, `CHARTTIME` is null, and `CHARTDATE` contains the date of the measurement.

In the cases where both `CHARTTIME` and `CHARTDATE` exists, `CHARTDATE` is equal to a truncated version of `CHARTTIME` (i.e. `CHARTTIME` without the timing information). Not all observations have a `CHARTTIME`, but all observations have a `CHARTDATE`.

## `SPEC_ITEMID`, `SPEC_TYPE_CD`, `SPEC_TYPE_DESC`

Details the itemid, code, and description for the specimen.

## `ORG_ITEMID`, `ORG_CD`, `ORG_NAME`

## `ISOLATE_NUM`

## `AB_ITEMID`, `AB_CD`, `AB_NAME`

## `DILUTION_TEXT`, `DILUTION_COMPARISON`, `DILUTION_VALUE`

## `INTERPRETATION`

`INTERPRETATION` indicates the results of the test. "S" is sensitive, "R" is resistant, "I" is intermediate, and "P" is pending.
