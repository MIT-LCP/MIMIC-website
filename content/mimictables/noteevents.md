# The noteevents table

**Table source:** Hospital database.

**Table purpose:** Contains all notes for patients.

**Number of rows:**

**Links to:**

* PATIENTS on `SUBJECT_ID`
* ADMISSIONS on `HADM_ID`
* CAREGIVERS on `CGID`

# Important considerations

* `TEXT` is often large and contains many newline characters: it may be easier to read if viewed in a distinct program rather than the one performing the queries.
* Echo reports, ECG reports, and radiology reports are available for both inpatient and outpatient stays. If a patient is an outpatient, there will not be an `HADM_ID` associated with the note. If the patient is an inpatient, but was not admitted to the ICU for that particular hospital admission, then there will *not* be an `HADM_ID` associated with the note.
* Echos are generated using templates and in some cases there may be discrepancies in severity.  For example one report may contain: "Mild PA systolic hypertension. Severe PA systolic hypertension." indicating that the caregiver may not have removed the appropriate item from the template.

## `CHARTDATE`

`CHARTDATE` records the date at which the note was charted.

## `CATEGORY`, `DESCRIPTION`

`CATEGORY` and `DESCRIPTION` define the type of note recorded. For example, a `CATEGORY` of 'Discharge' indicates that the note is a discharge note, and a `DESCRIPTION` of 'Summary' in conjunction with this indicates that the note is a discharge summary.
