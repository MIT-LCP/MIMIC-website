# Waveforms vs. clinical data

This website provides documentation for the MIMIC-III Clinical Database. A separate, complementary resource named the "MIMIC-III Waveform Database" contains high resolution waveforms and numerics (second by second derived values from the waveforms). __Work to link waveform data with the MIMIC-III Clinical Database is still underway. Please check here for updates on our progress.__

<!--
The waveform data can be accessed through PhysioNetBank and requires no log-in, [here](http://physionet.org/bank/mimic3wdb).

Detail on how to match records from the clinical database and the waveform database is provided on PhysioNetBank [here](http://physionet.org/bank/mimic3cdb).
