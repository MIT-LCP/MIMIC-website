The HOSP module contains data derived from the hospital wide EHR of BIDMC and NHMC. These measurements are predominantly recorded during the hospital stay, though some tables include data from outside the hospital as well (e.g. outpatient laboratory tests in *labevents*). 

Information includes patient and admission details (*patients*, *admissions*), laboratory measurements (*labevents*, *d_labitems*), hospital billing information (*diagnoses_icd*, *d_icd_diagnoses*), medication orders (*prescriptions*), and electronic medication administration records (*emar*).
