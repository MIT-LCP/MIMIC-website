## Detailed description

The *admissions* table defines all hospitalizations in the database. Hospitalizations are assigned a unique random integer known as the `hadm_id`.

### `subject_id`

`subject_id` is unique identifier for each patient. `subject_id` is unique to each row and can be used to identify data associated with a specific patient. It is a cryptographic random number and each patient has a `subject_id` which is consistent across tables.

### `hadm_id`

Each row of this table contains a unique `hadm_id`, which represents a single patient's admission to the hospital. It is possible for this table to have duplicate `subject_id`, indicating that a single patient had multiple admissions to the hospital. The ADMISSIONS table can be linked to the *patients* table using `subject_id`.

### `admittime`

`admittime` provides the date and time the patient was admitted to the hospital.

### `dischtime`

`dischtime` provides the date and time the patient was discharged from the hospital.

### `deathtime`

`deathtime` provides the time of in-hospital death for the patient. Note that `deathtime` is only present if the patient died in-hospital, and if present is almost always the same as the patientâ€™s dischtime. However, there may be some discrepancies.

### `admission_type`

`admission_type` is useful for classifying the urgency of the admission. There are 6 distinct additional admission types sourced from the NW EDW database: 'Emergency', 'Urgent', 'Elective', 'Elective-Routine', and 'Trauma'.
 
### `admission_location`

`admission_location` provides information about the hospital department into which the patient was initially admitted. There are 24 admission locations from NW EDW, including  'Neurology', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Pediatrics', 'Medicine', 'Respiratory Therapy', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiac Rehabilitation', 'Pre-Admission Testing', 'Neurological Intensive Care', 'Orthopaedic Surgery', 'Sleep Medicine', 'Gastroenterology', 'Unknown', 'Obstetrics and Gynecology', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Research', 'Intensive Care', 'Gynecology', 'Pediatric Intensive Care', 'Radiology', 'Pathology', 'Obstetrics', and 'Surgery'. Note, 'Pediatrics' is the name of the unit or room, which is not necessarily exclusively for pediatric patients. The data being shared pertains to the adult hospital, with patients aged 18 and above.


## `discharge_location`

Similarly, `discharge_location` is the disposition of the patient after they are discharged from the hospital. There are 33 discharge locations from NW EDW. Some of the 33 discharge locations are suppressed under 'Other Facility' for privacy.
